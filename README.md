IDEAS / TODO:
1. smart sorting of available rawDat (sort the text files into classes using avaiable metadata).
2. Build a generative language model to test language modeling & learning architecture approaches (word vs char vs sentence level)
3. Build a generative model for time series (need to capture features of data & not necessarely forecasts of data - that can be a separate model in itself and may just as well use classical statistical forecasting approaches)
3. Use above model (Encoder /Decoder) or come up with improvements (GAN appraoch)
